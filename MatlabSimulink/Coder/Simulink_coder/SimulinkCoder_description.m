%{
Simulink Coder™ (formerly Real-Time Workshop®) generates and executes C and C++ code from Simulink® models,
Stateflow® charts, and MATLAB® functions. The generated source code can be used for real-time and 
nonreal-time applications, including simulation acceleration, rapid prototyping, and hardware-in-the-loop
testing. You can tune and monitor the generated code using Simulink or run and interact with the code 
outside MATLAB and Simulink. 

To share your Simulink simulations as standalone executables, web apps, or Functional Mockup Units (FMUs),
use Simulink Compiler™.
