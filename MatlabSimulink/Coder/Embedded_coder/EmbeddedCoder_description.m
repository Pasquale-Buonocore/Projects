Embedded coder:
Embedded Coder® generates readable, compact, and fast C and C++ code for embedded processors
used in mass production. It extends MATLAB Coder™ and Simulink Coder™ with advanced optimizations for 
precise control of the generated functions, files, and data. These optimizations improve code efficiency
and facilitate integration with legacy code, data types, and calibration parameters.
You can incorporate a third-party development tool to build an executable for turnkey deployment
on your embedded system or rapid prototyping board.
