%{
MATLAB Compiler SDK™ extends the functionality of MATLAB Compiler™ to let you build C/C++ shared 
libraries, Microsoft® .NET assemblies, Java® classes, and Python® packages from MATLAB® programs.
These components can be integrated with custom applications and then deployed to desktop, web, and 
enterprise systems.

MATLAB Compiler SDK includes a development version of MATLAB Production Server™ for testing and 
debugging application code and Excel add-ins before deploying them to web applications and enterprise 
systems.

Applications created using software components from MATLAB Compiler SDK can be shared royalty-free with
users who do not need MATLAB. These applications use the MATLAB Runtime, a set of shared libraries 
that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components.

To generate C and C++ source code from MATLAB, use MATLAB Coder™.
